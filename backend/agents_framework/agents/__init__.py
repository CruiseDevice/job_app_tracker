Agents Framework Initialization

This module provides easy access to all agents in the framework.

Currently, no specialized agents are implemented. Agents can be added here
as they are developed. Each agent should inherit from BaseAgent and follow
the agent protocol defined in agents_framework.core.agent_protocol.
